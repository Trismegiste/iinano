A social network that follows SOLID -- **Work in progress**

## What
It's a private social network web application for small communities/business.
Built on Symfony2 & MongoDB, it is an attempt to keep things small, light, simple
and intuitive.

## Why
Because after struggling with Elgg (almost dead) and Oxwall (coding horror) and
reviewing the newly Idno (critical design flaws and no unit tests),
I've decided to NOT contribute to Idno (sadly) but to retain the philosophy
and rewrite this app.

## How
Using Symfony2 and MongoDB. A graph database is
the logical choice but too complicated (users don't care about how are stored their
datas). Three rules to bind them all :

* Keep It Simple Stupid
* Lightweight
* SOLID or die

Of course all fancy stuffs like Composer, PhpUnit, Twig, PureCSS and jQuery.

## Who
Small business, small communities ( from 1000 to 100k people could be cool I think ).
Everything is public in the community and you can filter contents by your following,
your followers and your friends. A friend is a following and a follower.

## When
Your customer wants to own his data ! If he's a manager, he's fed up
with his employees sharing critical business data and secrets
on public full-open social networks since on a regular basis, facebook
has security issues which put all contents in free access for everyone. Or a community
leader is lost in the noise generated by those networks. No ads, no game, just content.

## Where
Local server and AWS of course !
